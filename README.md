# Analysis of sensor signal
This code performs basic analysis on signals obtained from sensors such as biological signals (ECG, ECG, etc.) and inertial signals (acceleration signals, gyro signals, etc.). Specifically, the following contents were implemented.

-Noise Removal, Variation Removal
-Feature Extraction
-Anomaly Detection, Change Detection
-Classification, Pattern Matching
-Prediction

## Noise Removal, Variation Removal
-Extended Kalman Filter(6-axis IMU)

## Feature Extraction
-Time Field Statistics
-Power Spectrum Statistic


## Anomaly Detection, Change Detection
-Singular Spectrum Transformation

## Classification, Pattern Matching
-Dynamic Time Warping

## Prediction
-Statistical Model
-Machine Learning
